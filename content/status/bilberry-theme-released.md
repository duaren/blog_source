I'm glad to announce the release of the Bilberry Hugo theme[ V3.8.0](https://github.com/Lednerb/bilberry-hugo-theme). 
This premium theme is published under an open-source license ([MIT](https://github.com/Lednerb/bilberry-hugo-theme/blob/master/LICENSE.md)), and you can use it free of charge. 
It took significant amount of time to create and refine this theme. 
This theme is a collaborative effort of [numerous volunteers](https://github.com/Lednerb/bilberry-hugo-theme/graphs/contributors).
